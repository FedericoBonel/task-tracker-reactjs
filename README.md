# ReactJS task tracker

## Do you need to keep track of your daily tasks?
If so, keep reading this may be the app for you!

## What is ReactJS task tracker?
This is a simple web application that allows you to keep track of your daily tasks in a very simple and minimalistic manner. (I built it as an excuse to utilize a "Microservice" through Rest calls)

## What do I need to do to run it and start tracking my tasks?
Not too much, you just need node.js. Once you have that all you have to do is download this source code, go to it's root folder and build it, you can do it through this command: 
    
    npm run build

Once you have done that, you'll need to install some kind of server to run your app (you can use the serve package, more info: [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)).

## Is that all?
Not exactly, you'll need the back end of the application running in your 8080 port for it to work: Check out how to install it [here](https://github.com/FedericoBonel/task-tracker-reactjs-backend)
